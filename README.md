# Internship-Czen-bank-SQL
During my internship of CZEN Bank Dataset, I utilized SQL for data analysis and cleaning, handling a large dataset efficiently to derive meaningful insights and ensure data integrity.**I worked extensively with a complex dataset comprising seven tables and over 10 lakhs rows. This multifaceted data encompassed various aspects of transactions, accounts, districts, cards, and more, requiring thorough analysis and management using SQL techniques to extract valuable insights and ensure data accuracy.**
